# MIDI Player

MIDI Player (probably needs some better name) is a "beautiful" MIDI renderer. It's free and open source (BSD 2-Clause license).

## Building / Installing

NOTE: There are no binary distributions for now, as the app is not finished and there may be problems with proper packaging. You will need to build it from source. Only Linux is
supported. Other platforms don't even have MIDI input implemented.

See [build instructions](./docs/Build.md) for more details.

## Setting up

The two sources can be used for setting up the app:

* command line (see `midiplayer --help` for up-to-date help)
* config files (see [documentation](./docs/ConfigFile.md)).
